# Click Scale Animation

This repository contains a simple page with a click scale animation. When you click anywhere in the viewport, an element pops up and scales from 0 to 10.

## How It Works

The animation is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how it works:

1. When a click event is triggered anywhere in the viewport, an element appears at the clicked position.
2. Initially, the element has a scale of 0 and is hidden.
3. The element's position is set to the clicked coordinates using JavaScript.
4. After a short delay, the element's transition is set to smoothly animate the scale transformation.
5. The element's opacity and visibility are adjusted to make it visible.
6. The element's scale is set to 10 to achieve the desired visual effect.
7. After a certain duration, the element fades out by adjusting the opacity and visibility.

## Usage

To use the click scale animation in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project.
3. Customize the appearance and styling of the element to match your design.
4. Test the animation by opening the HTML file in a web browser.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different styles and effects to suit your needs.
